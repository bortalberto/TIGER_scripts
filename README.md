# TIGER_scripts
Test scripts for the CGEM project.

##Installation
The suggested Python version is 3.8. If it's not present in your system, install it with (on Ubuntu):
```
sudo apt install python3.8 
```
I suggest you to use a virtual environment, to do so you need python3.8-venv
```
sudo apt install python3.8-venv
```
You will also need the libpython3.8-dev package
```
sudo apt install libpython3.8-dev
```
To install gufi run
```
python3.8 installer.py
```
And answer "yes" to create you virtual environment\
Now simply run GUFI.sh to open GUFI
